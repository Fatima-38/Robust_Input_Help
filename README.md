ðŸ§¾ Interactive User Input Form
This Python program demonstrates interactive user input validation using functions for reading and verifying different types of inputs.
It ensures the user provides non-empty text, selects a valid choice from a list, and enters a numeric value within a specified range.
The script then displays a formatted summary of the userâ€™s responses including their name, preferred activity, and CGPA.
This task highlights the use of loops, input validation, and error handling for building reliable user-interactive programs. ðŸ§ ðŸ’¡
